# walmart dataset my sql data analysis beginner project
This is one of my beginner projects to practice my SQL skills for data analysis.
It's about a short dataset from Kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/varsharam/walmart-sales-dataset-of-45stores

I do different queries about the information given.
I practice the follow SQL methods:
 - SELECT * FROM
 - WHERE
 - MAX()
 - MIN()
 - ORDER BY
 - ASC
 - DESC
 - LIMIT
 - SELECT DISTINCT
 - UPDATE
 - SET
 - ALTER TABLE
 - MODIFY
